# Ruby Oauth Typhoeus Wrapper

This project provides a very simple wrapper example class which supports adding the Google ServiceAccount Oauth 2.0 
flow to simple Typheous requests.

## Citations

This project could not be possible without the wonderful work of the [Typhoeus Project](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus).

## Usage

Currently, there is no gem, or unit tests, or anything that will help you work with this class, and there most likely 
will never be such a thing.  So, to use this code, simply copy/paste the class definition for OauthTyphoeus (available
in [oauth-test.rb](oauth-test.rb)) into your code, initialize it and then refer to the Typhoeus documentation for usage.
   
A sample is included in the ruby file, which shows how to use it with google cloud storage.
